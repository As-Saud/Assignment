        <h3>A Front End web developer,</h3> in training, and also a Biochemistry undergraduate in the Faculty of life
        science, University of Ilorin, my undying love for becoming a software developer has pushed me to embark on this
        delightful journey, which is why i am here and enjoying it. Learning to code is gradually changing my world. I
        love to build websites and have passion for responsive web designs and finding solution.<br>
        Loving the process as much as the outcome, I take a collaborative, creative and strategic approach to solving
        problems.</p>
